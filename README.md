# Advent of Code (2019)

A collection of my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code (2019)](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about).

The code is meant to be quick and dirty. If you're searching for elegance and efficiency this isn't the repository for you.

Most solutions will be in JavaScript and numbered by the challenge index.

If you want to run the first solution you can directly run `node src/day_1.js` in the directory of this project.

I'm running Node `v10.15.3`.
